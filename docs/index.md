# Free Threaded Python Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Free Threaded Python and the ft_utils library. This documentation provides an introduction to the concepts and best practices of concurrent programming in Free Threaded Python, as well as a comprehensive guide to the ft_utils API.

## Introduction

* [Introduction to Free Threaded Python and ft_utils](introduction.md) - An overview of Free Threaded Python and the ft_utils library, including their purpose and benefits.

## Atomicity in Python

* [Solving Atomicity/Consistency Issues in Free Threaded Python](atomicity_in_Python.md) - A discussion of atomicity and consistency issues in Free Threaded Python, including solutions and best practices.

## ft_utils API Documentation

* [concurrent Module Documentation](concurrent_api.md) - Documentation for the concurrent module, which provides foundational structures for scalable and efficient Free Threaded code.
* [ft_utils API Documentation](ft_utils_api.md) - An overview of the ft_utils API, including its modules and classes.
* [local Module Documentation](local_api.md) - Documentation for the local module, which provides helper classes for moving processing from cross-thread to thread-local.
* [synchronization Module Documentation](synchronization_api.md) - Documentation for the synchronization module, which provides specialized lock types for Free Threaded programming.

## Examples
